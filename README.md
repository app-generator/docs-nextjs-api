This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. First clone the GitHub repository and navigate into the project folder:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/app-generator/core-nextjs.git`
    cd core-nextjs
```

2. Next, install dependencies:

```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
```

3. Finally, run the development server:

```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
